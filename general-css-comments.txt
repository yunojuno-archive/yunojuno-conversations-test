Overall I think the CSS is done well, great use of variables and componentising the code that it's easier to reason about and find relevant code.

There seem to be a lot of uses of the "!important" flag across the project, which may not cause issues for you but in my experience can be a pain when trying to modify the value later with javascript or a different CSS rule.
If the issue is overwriting specificity due to chained selectors, perhaps the BEM approach of using "__" for children of components (eg. "Button__icon") could help?

As someone with no prior experience with the code, I would've found it very useful to have more uniform and descriptive comments within component files.
For example the avatar.styl there are several block comments delineating different sections of the component, but I'm not really sure what each of those sections represent.

One small thing is that when writing CSS I tend to try and organise the order of properties in a given selector, eg as shown here https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/.
I find it can just make it a bit easier to understand the code more quickly.

Another minor thing I noted was that there are several comments using "//", which works fine because CSS doesn't understand it and so ignores it, but according to the spec the only valid comments are written using "/* */".
