I tried to avoid too much refactoring of existing code, and I tried to follow existing conventions where possible.

I wasn't exactly sure what was required in terms of form validation so I just checked for any non-whitespace input.
Regardless the set up is there so that it would be easy to add additional conditions to the isValidForm function.
I also chose to make this function take in the form as an argument as I'm currently in the habit of writing in a relatively functional style.
I believe writing in this style makes code a bit more re-usable (easier to drop in somewhere else if you're not using "this") and easier to test.

Also, the tests for the clear attachment button are slightly inadequate as they can't check whether a file was really removed (because you can't add a file in the testing environment), not sure if much can be done about that.
